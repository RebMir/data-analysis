# 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib

## 📁 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to load, clean, analyze, and visualize data using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** in Python. 
The dataset used is the classic **Iris Dataset**, which contains information about iris flowers such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width across three species.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset using Pandas
- Perform basic statistical analysis
- Group and summarize data
- Visualize insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 📌 Features
- Handling missing data
- Generating statistical summaries (`mean`, `std`, `median`)
- Grouping by species
- Line plot for trends
- Bar chart comparison
- Histogram for distribution
- Scatter plot for relationships
